Pixledit
========

**Note:** This is a personal toy project.

A simple image editor geared towards pixel art. Created with JavaFX.

Current features (subject to change):

* you can put red pixels on a white background
* dragging the left mouse button across the canvas creates a stream of
  disconnected red pixels
* the background is 300x275 px
* you can save that creation to a file called "image.png"
