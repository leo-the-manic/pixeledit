Pixledit
========

**Note:** This is a personal toy project.

A simple image editor geared towards pixel art. Created with JavaFX.

Current features (subject to change):

* you can put pixels on a white background
* dragging the left mouse button across the canvas creates a stream of
  disconnected pixels
* the background is 300x275 px
* you can save that creation to a file called "image.png"

I know, I know. How did I ever program so many amazing features? Even I'm not
sure how I do it.

Uh... I don't have any contributing guidelines. If you are interested in
contributing, send me a message and I'll flesh out a process. But I have a
feeling I'm writing this readme entirely for my own benefit.
